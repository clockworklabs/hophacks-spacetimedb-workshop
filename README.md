# SpacetimeDB TypeScript + React Quickstart Chat

This is a simple chat application that demonstrates how to use SpacetimeDB with TypeScript and React. The chat application is a simple chat room where users can send messages to each other. The chat application uses SpacetimeDB to store the chat messages.

It is based directly on the plain React + TypeScript + Vite template. You can follow the quickstart guide for how creating this project from scratch at [SpacetimeDB TypeScript Quickstart](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/sdks/typescript/quickstart).

You can follow the instructions for creating your own SpacetimeDB module here: [SpacetimeDB Rust Module Quickstart](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/modules/rust/quickstart). Place the module in the `quickstart-chat/server` directory for compability with this project.

In order to run this example, you need to:

- `npm install` in this directory
- `npm build` in this directory
- `npm dev` in this directory to run the example
